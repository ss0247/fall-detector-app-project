# Fall Detector Android App

## INTRODUCTION

A Fall Detection app based on Machine Learning model

## USER GUIDE

* Make sure to configure the emergency phone number for the app to call automatically when a fall is detected.
* Calls from that number will be answered automatically.
* The app will start automatically when the phone is turned on.
* For optimal performance (to reduce the number of false alarms and the number of undetected falls) carry the device close to your waist (a trouser pocket, a belt clip, etc.).
* Keep your device charged at all times.

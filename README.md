# Experimental Fall Detector Android App

## INTRODUCTION

In short: When a fall is detected the app will send an SMS to the configured emergency phone number.

## USER GUIDE

* Make sure to configure the emergency phone number for the app to call automatically when a fall is detected.
* Calls from that number will be answered automatically.
* An SMS from that number with the word POSITION in the content will be replied to automatically with the geographical position (if available).
* If the SMS contains the word ALARM instead, it will play back an alarm sound.
* The app will start automatically when the phone is turned on.
* For optimal performance (to reduce the number of false alarms and the number of undetected falls) carry the device close to your waist (a trouser pocket, a belt clip, etc.).
* Keep your device charged at all times.
